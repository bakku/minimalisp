# Tiny Lisp

After reading [Crafting Interpreters](www.craftinginterpreters.com) Tiny Lisp is my small take
on writing a programming language from scratch. It mimicks the approach of the *jlox* implementation
and uses a tree-walking approach to interpret source code.

## Compiling

To compile Tiny Lisp just execute:

```
make
```

Golang must be installed, of course.
